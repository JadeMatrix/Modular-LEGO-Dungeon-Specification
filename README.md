# Modular *LEGO*® Tabletop RPG Dungeons

![](media/readme_header.png)

The goal of this project is to establish a reasonable standard of modular gameplay sections, constructed entirely of [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/), for the playing of [tabletop role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game).

Head over to the [specification document](Specification.md) to read about the details, or take a look at the various [examples](examples/).
